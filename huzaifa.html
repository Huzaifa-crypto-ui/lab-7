<h2>What is Demon Slayer?</h2>
<p>
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba (Japanese: 鬼滅の刃) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Koyoharu Gotouge. 
It is set in Taisho-era Japan and tells the story of Tanjiro Kamado, a kind-hearted boy who becomes a demon slayer after his family is slaughtered by demons.

<p>
The only survivor is his younger sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a demon but surprisingly retains some of her humanity. 
Tanjiro joins the Demon Slayer Corps to find a cure for Nezuko and avenge his family by hunting down the demon responsible for their deaths.
